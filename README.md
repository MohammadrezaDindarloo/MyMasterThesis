## Abstract
In today's world, robots have found a special place in various fields, including medicine, agriculture, and navigation industries. This thesis focuses on simplifying the use and increasing the accuracy of robotic systems by reducing repetitive pre-operation processes, such as sensor calibration. By leveraging graph-based algorithms, this research aims to develop a unified framework that simultaneously addresses sensor calibration, robot calibration, and localization, providing an integrated and flexible solution. The proposed approach is validated on a suspended underactuated parallel cable robot, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex robotic tasks and environmental uncertainties.

It covers the mathematical formulation, algorithm design, and the integration of various robotic tasks such as sensor and robot calibration. The methodology section provides insights into the theoretical underpinnings and the practical considerations involved in implementing this framework.

## Implementation
The implementation of the proposed framework is demonstrated on a suspended underactuated parallel cable robot. The setup includes the calibration of vision sensors, kinematic modeling, and the incorporation of cable deflection models. This section also discusses the software and hardware environments used in the experiments.

## Results
The results section highlights the effectiveness of the proposed approach. By comparing the performance of the graph-based framework with traditional methods, the thesis shows significant improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency. The results are supported by extensive simulations and real-world experiments.

## Conclusion
The thesis concludes with a summary of the findings, emphasizing the benefits of the proposed graph-based framework in robot calibration and state estimation. It also discusses the potential for this approach to be applied in other robotic domains.

## Future Work
The thesis outlines several directions for future research, including the extension of the framework to more complex robotic systems, the incorporation of additional sensors, and the exploration of real-time implementation possibilities.
